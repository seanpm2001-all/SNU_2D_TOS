<H1>Terms of Service - Monetization</H1>
<p>With SNU, you can easily monetize your content. When you monetize your content, you earn money when people view ads</p>
<p>Keep in mind, with SNU, people can control what ads they see. You will earn 1 cent for every 40 ads that are played. SNU earns 1 cent from the first 20 ads, and you earn 1 cent for the other 20 ads, perfectly balanced.</p>
<p>When you monetize your content, ads will play around or in it. This may seem very little, but overtime this builds up. For example: 20000 ads from 1000 visitors on a single piece of content will earn you $5.00.</p>
<p>Still think that is little? If you have lots of content, that number can go even higher when visitors view your other content. Notice: you cannot give yourself ad revenue through your own IP address.</p>
<p>If someone is skipping your ads with the ad skip button, or if they close the ad, you still earn revenue. If someone skips ads through an ad blocker, unfortunately none of us get money, but the person with the ad blocker loses money.</p>
<p>Because if someone is stealing money from you, they should repay with the revenue they didn't give.</p>
<p>If you are using an adblocker, however, every ad that gets skipped will make you lose 1 cent out of your account balance. This may not seem like much, but if you do it too often, your monetization revenue can easily go into the negatives.</p>
<p>If your monetization revenue reaches -0.01, you will receive warnings to disable your ad blocker, warnings that your ad blocker can't remove. If your balance goes to -20.00, your monetization will be suspended.</p>
